Code12 Programming Concepts
===========================

The Code12 system is designed to allow students to concentrate
on these 12 core programming concepts, ideally introduced in
this order:


Concept                     Example
-------                     ----------
1. Procedure Calls          ct.circle( 100, 200, 50 )
2. Comments                 // Make the borders
3. Variables                int x = 50;
4. Expressions              (i * 3) + 20
5. Function Calls           fish = ct.image( "goldfish.png", 100, 200, 50 )
6. Object Data Fields       fish.x
7. Object Method Calls      ball.setFillColor( "blue" )
8. If-else                  if (fish.x < 0)
9. Function Definitions     void updateScore()
10. Parameters              GameObj makeAsteroid( double x, double y )
11. Loops                   for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
12. Arrays                  GameObj[] asteroids = new GameObj[10];


Java Subset Restrictions
========================

In order to allow Code12 to do what it needs to do 
(give better error messages, translate to Lua, etc.),
we only support a subset of Java. The subset supports
all of the above constructs. Intentionally left out are:

* No class definitions. All code must live inside the MainProgram class.
* The only object types allowed are GameObj and String.
* No use of new, except for arrays. GameObj and String objects are returned by methods.
* No use of the Java Class Library beyond the String and Math methods indicated.
* No use of byte, char, short, long, or float (only int, double, and bool).
* No type casts (use the conversion functions provided).

There will be other syntax restrictions as well, and some enforcement of style,
for example:

* No multi-statement lines.
* Line breaks are only allowed after complete statements/constructs, 
  with a few exceptions (such as after a comma in a parameter list).
* if and else and the controlled statements must be all on their own lines.
* For now, { and } must always be on their own line.
* Assignment operators (=, +=, etc.) and ++ and -- make statements not expressions.
* Object field/method access cannot be chained, so no a.b.c or a().b
* No overloading in user-defined functions (only one parameter list signature).
* Indentation errors will be enforced or warned. 


Ideas for Programming Concepts as Levels
========================================
If the 12 programming concepts are taught in order, then the user can progress
through 12 programming levels, which each add a capability. Here are some ideas
for ways to use the Code12 API at each level:

1. Procedure Calls
------------------
* Print messages using ct.println()
* Use mixtures of ct.print() and ct.println()
* Show messages with ct.showAlert()
* Use mixtures of ct.pritntln() and ct.showAlert()
* Use ct.setBackColor(), ct.setBackColorRGB(), and ct.setBackImage()
* Draw objects and scenes using ct.circle(), ct.rect(), ct.line(). ct.text(), and ct.image()
* Play a sound with ct.sound()
* Play sounds with ct.alert() separated by alerts with ct.showAlert() to sequence them

2. Comments
-----------
* Make sequences of procedure calls easier to understand with comments before code lines
* Draw a complex scene, broken up with comments and blank lines
* Explain the purpose of a program with a comment at the beginning of the program
* Put your name, date, assignment number, etc. in a program in a comment
* Explain something about a procedure call with a comment at the end of the line
* Disable a line by commenting it out with //, then bring it back by removing the //
* Disable a large block of procedure calls with a block comment /* */

3. Variables
------------
* Replace repeated uses of the same x or y coordinate with a variable and adjust it
* Use a variable for a size and adjust it
* Define int shade and use it for ct.setBackColorRRGB( shade, shade, shade )
* Set a String variable to a message or ASCII art, and use it with repeated ct.println() calls
* Try the above with 3-4 String variables to print the american flag.
* Write a series of procedure calls to draw something with variables, then copy-paste it to re-use 
  several times unmodified but with different variable assignments before each use.

4. Expressions
--------------
* Use expressions to convert feet to inches, F to C, etc. and print results
* Set a variable to a y-coordiante, then add offsets from it to draw nearby objects
* Calculate the midpoint of two x values and use it to draw something in the middle
* Draw a scene where coordiantes and sizes are calculated relative to a few variables
* Draw several rectangles of the same aspect (a variable), at different positions and sizes
* Write a series of procedure calls to draw something with variables, then copy-paste it to 
  re-use several times unmodified but with y = y + 10 and similar between them.
* Calculate and draw graphs and geometry. For example, draw coordinate axes, then plot 
  y = mx + b given variables m and b

5. Function Calls
-----------------
* Use ct.inputNumber() to ask for inputs to a calculation or game parameters
* Use ct.inputString() to ask the user their name then display/output using it
* Use ct.random() to draw objects at random positions and/or sizes
* Use Math.sin() and other Math methods to calculate and draw things
* Use ct.round(), ct.roundDecimal(), ct.intDiv(), ct.distance(), ct.getTimer(), ct.getVersion()
* Use ct.toInt(), ct.formatDecimal(), ct.formatInt() to prepare data for display

6. Object Data Fields
---------------------
* Make a GameObj move smoothly be setting its xSpeed and/or ySpeed field in start() 
* Make a GameObj move smoothly by changing its x and/or y fields in update()
* Make an object grow/shrink by changing its width or height in update()
* Make a thick outline by setting an object's lineWidth field after creation
* Use autoDelete = true so objects delete after going offscreen via xSpeed/ySpeed 
* Set the group field of a set of objects that you want to delete in bulk via ct.clearGroup()  

7. Object Method Calls
----------------------


8. If-else
----------


9. Function Definitions
-----------------------


10. Parameters
--------------


11. Loops
---------


12. Arrays
----------
