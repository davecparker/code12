<h4>About Code12</h4>
<p>Code12 is a programming environment designed for introductory programming education,
especially for a first-semester college programming class, high school programming class,
or for independent self-paced learning and experimentation. In a class or series where
the Java language is used, Code12 provides an introduction to programming using a
subset of the Java language, to give students a solid grounding on the fundamentals of
programming and an intuitive introduction to using objects before they
continue on to "full" Java and object-oriented program design. 
Learn more about Code12's teaching philosophy and methods 
<a href="concepts.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Code12 includes a very simple and <a href="docs/1/API.html">fully documented API</a> 
that allows students to develop 2D graphics, games, and simulations with shapes, images,
sound, and mouse and keyboard input, as well as simple text-based applications. 
The API includes a set of simple functions, plus fields and methods for a graphical
object type to introduce the use of objects in an intuitive and visual way.</p>

    <p>The Code12 application includes a graphics display area for graphics output 
    and game play, a text console for text output, and an automatic variable watch 
    window for inspecting variable values in real time.</p>

    <p>Errors in the user's code are clearly highlighted with source code context and links 
    to relevant help articles.</p>
    <p>Error messages are designed for beginners and include common problems not caught
    by a normal Java compiler.</p>
    <p>Smart source code parsing and the omitting of some language features helps syntax 
    and other errors be accurately located on the correct line and include helpful details.</p> 
  </div>
</div>


<p>Combined with the text editor of your choice, the Code12 application provides a "live"
visual programming environment with instant change-compile-run response and error messages
that are dramatically better for beginners than a typical Java compiler.</p>

<p>When you're ready for more, the optional Code12 Java Package enables the
<a href="docs/1/API.html">Code12 API</a> to be used with any (full) 
Java programming environment.</p>

<p>Code12 is free to use for education and personal use.</p>
