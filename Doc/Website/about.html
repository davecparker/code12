<h4>About Code12</h4>
  <p>Code12 is the Java Programming environment designed for education, especially for an introductory first-semester college
  programming class, high school programming class, or independent self-paced learning and experimentation.</p>
  <p>Easily develop 2D graphics, games, and simulations, and simple text-based applications 
    using the <a href="docs/1/API.html">Code12 API</a>.
  The Code12 API provides a gentle and intuitive introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP), in conjunction with simple
  procedural programming, to clear the path for students to concentrate on learning the basics of programming, without the complexity of Java and OOP getting in the way.</p>
  <p>Combined with the text editor of your choice, the Code12 application implements a subset of the Java language designed for introductory education, with instant edit-compile-run response and friendly error messages designed with beginners in mind.
  When you're ready for more, the optional Code12 Java Package enables the 
  <a href="docs/1/API.html">Code12 API</a> to be used with any (full) Java programming environment.</p>
  <p>Code12 is free to use for education and personal use.</p>

<h5>Learning Fundamentals: Sometimes Less is More</h5>
<p>Code12's goal is to allow students to concentrate on learning and practicing the fundamental building 
blocks of computer programming, while removing the typical barriers that a traditional Java development 
environment causes.</p> 
<p>New programmers cannot learn everything at once, and Code12 allows students to
progress through the basics without being confused or distracted by  other complexities that they 
haven't learned yet or don't yet understand. To do this, Code12:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implements only a subset of the the Java language, significantly improving syntax error messages.</li>
	<li>Checks and enforces indentation and bracket style, drastically improving the reporting
	of structural errors.</li>
	<li>Has an adjustable syntax level, to eliminate error messages that presume knowledge of language
	concepts that the student has not learned yet.</li>
	<li>Includes a simple and fun API that requires no understanding of object-oriented concepts
	to get started with, then introduces simple objects in an intuitive way. </li>
	<li>Doesn't require (and doesn't use) the Java Class Library.
</ul>
