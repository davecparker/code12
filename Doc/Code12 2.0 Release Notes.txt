Code12 2.0 Release Notes
========================

The changes listed below were made to Code12 since version 1.0.

Also note that since some changes were made to the API and online documentation,
the new 2.0 docs are in:

     http://www.code12.org/docs/2/API.html
     http://www.code12.org/docs/2/Java.html

instead of the corresponding "docs/1/" folder where the version 1.0 docs where.
This means that existing links to the help (e.g. reading assignments) will need 
to be changed when you start using version 2.0. 


Enhancements Added since Code12 1.0
-----------------------------------
* The "if-else" programming concept is now concept #6 instead of concept #8
(and therefore taught before object fields and methods instead of after them).
This allows teaching it sooner where there are various text I/O applications.
Since it is now before object fields and methods (now concepts #7 and #8),
the if-else examples in the Java help docs now use all text output. 

* The variable watch window can now display local variables as well as the
program's class-level variables. Since local variables go out of scope when a 
function returns, however, you will only see them if you insert a ct.pause()
call to pause the execution. You will then see the locals that are in scope
at that point in the code, in a section below the class-level variables.

* Ignoring the return value of a function is now considered an error
(although this is not an error in Java, it is a very common beginner mistake).
Exceptions are made for the graphic object creation functions (e.g. ct.circle()),
which return a GameObj reference but have primary and useful side-effects.
The function ct.loadSound() was changed to no longer return a boolean, so it would
not be another exception. All other API and user-defined functions are enforced.

* The font size used for the console output (e.g. ct.println() output), 
source code error displays, and the variable watch window is now adjustable.
You can choose from 3 sizes in the Code12 Options screen. This can be used to
make the text easier to see when using a projector.

* The links at the beginning of the Code12 function reference are now organized 
into sections of different types of functions (e.g. returning a value or not), 
corresponding to the order in which students will learn these concepts. This makes 
it easier to identify the functions that a student can use at various levels. 

* Added Java help sections for array.length and arrays as parameters.

* Added obj.id as a new public data field to the GameObj type (see docs).

* Calling ct.pause() now shows a popup alert in the app instead of 
printing a message to the console.

* The += operator can now be used to append a String to a String
(but not a number to a String, this intentionally still gets an error).


Selected Bug Fixes
------------------
* An "enhanced for loop" operating on an array of String or GameObj, such as:
     for (GameObj obj: objects)
now correctly processes the entire array instead of stopping at the first null object.

* Due to technical limitations, when a Java program is run directly from a 
flash drive on Windows (or any drive different from the system/C: drive), 
loading images or sounds will typically fail (images will result in a red "[X]"). 
Although we could not fix this completely, a warning message is now printed to the 
console suggesting that the user copy their project folder to the desktop.

* An infinite loop in the user's code no longer hangs the Code12 app.
You can now use the Stop button in the toolbar to terminate the program.
Also, the screen attempts to keep updating at close to the normal frame rate,
and if a loop takes longer than 3 seconds without yielding for user input,
then a warning is printed to the console as an FYI for the user.
